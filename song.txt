I have a dream
that's all I need
I'll make it happen with some work and believe
know what I want
so ill take it on
I've made mistakes but mistakes make you strong
let's break it down for a minute
I want the crown Im gon get it
you hear me loud man I'm winning
yea charley sheen would be grinning
these ladies know that I'm sinning
and this is just the beginning
I'm closing in the 9th inning
there ain't no point in resisting
